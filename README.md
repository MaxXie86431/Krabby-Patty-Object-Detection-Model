# Krabby-Patty-Object-Detection-Model
This project detects Krabby Patties from SpongeBob clips and draws bounding boxes around them when detected. Message me for dataset, labels, and pretrained model with weights if you want to use this code. This project is meant to be run on google colab. First, run the first two cells in the code to empty your cache in torch and create directories. Then upload the image dataset to /content/krabbypatty and upload the labels to /content/labels. You also have to screen record a spongebob clip from youtube and upload that to /content/testvid to test the detection model. You can manually train your model by changing the epochs, batch size, learning rate, and weights, or you can use a pretrained model that I can give you. The next step is optional, but if you wish to have mean average precision as an accuracy metric, you must manually annotate your test clip using a website called CVAT to get the ground truths to calculate mean average precision. Finally, the results will be shown in /content/detectionoutput and you can download it to local.
